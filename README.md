# A Rust-Based Text Editor

Well, it isn't really a text editor yet-but one day it will be. 

Seemed like a good way to start teaching myself some Rust when I have the spare time. So much of the coding I do these days is through AI, and I wanted a project that I could completely write by hand. I'm sure it'll be terrible for a while, but hopefully it can eventually be something.
